# ChatGPT explains covert channels to a 5 year old :

Covert channels are like secret ways that two friends use to talk without anyone else knowing. Imagine two friends, Tim and Sarah, sitting in a big room. They don't want their parents to hear what they're saying.

1. Covert Storage Channels :
	- Tim and Sarah have a hidden diary. Tim writes something in it, and then he leaves it in a special hiding place. Later, Sarah finds the diary and reads what Tim wrote. They're sharing secrets by using the hidden diary like a secret letter.
2. Covert Timing Channels :
	- Instead of writing, Tim blinks a flashlight, and Sarah watches. They have a secret code: one blink means "yes," and two blinks mean "no." So, they talk without making any sound, just by blinking the flashlight in their secret code.
 
So, covert channels are like secret games where Tim and Sarah share their secrets without anyone else knowing. But in the computer world, some people use secret tricks like these to do sneaky things, so computer experts need to stop them.
